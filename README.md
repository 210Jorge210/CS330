How do I approach designing software?
-- I start with planning out what I would want the proejct to be by the end of the project.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
 - By keeping my code organized, it helped with reading where eveyrhting was and it made fixes easier.
What design process did you follow for your project work?
 - Simple testing and adding something new each time 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
-By planning ahead and building and testing as I go, though time consuming will help me with bigger projects. 



How do I approach developing programs?
-write & then test small parts of my code and fix any potentail issues before I move on

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
-Just to test my code often even for the littlest adjustmenst to ensure that nothing major occured in a small tweak
How did iteration factor into your development?
-it would always find something to improve in each iterarion 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?-
- Throuhghout the milestones I become more organized in my coding, in the end making easier to read lines. 



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
-Computer scinece makes me think more logicaly and solve problems which can help in many fields even outside of technology 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
-It showed me that math and programming work together, with this helps in studying in advanced tech topics. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
-For me the skill I belive will help me in data visualization.
